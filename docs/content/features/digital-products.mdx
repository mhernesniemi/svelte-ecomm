# Digital Products

Hoikka supports both physical and digital products. The product `type` field (`physical` or `digital`) determines checkout behavior.

## How It Works

- **Physical products** require a shipping address and go through the shipping provider flow.
- **Digital products** skip shipping entirely. After payment, they trigger email delivery with download links or access instructions.

## Changing the Default Product Type

The default type for new products is set in `src/lib/config/products.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_PRODUCT_TYPE: ProductType = "physical";
```

Change this to `"digital"` if the store only sells digital products. All newly created products will then default to digital.

## Setting a Single Product as Digital

To change an individual product's type, update it via the product service:

```typescript
await productService.update(123, { type: "digital" });
```

## Checkout Behavior

When all items in a cart are digital:

1. The shipping step is skipped
2. No shipping address is collected
3. After successful payment, the order transitions to `Delivered`

When a cart contains a mix of physical and digital products, the standard shipping flow applies for the physical items.
