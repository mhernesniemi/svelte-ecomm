# Introduction

**Hoikka** is an opinionated, full-stack e-commerce platform built with SvelteKit.

It includes the storefront, admin panel, API, and business logic in a single lightweight codebase and is ready to deploy serverless.

## Philosophy: Code Over Configuration

Hoikka follows the principles of the [Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine), favoring clarity, strong defaults, and real application code over abstraction layers.

There are no plugin systems, configuration DSLs, or hidden admin logic. Everything is plain TypeScript that you can read, change, and extend directly.

This also makes Hoikka well-suited for AI-assisted development - the codebase is structured so that both humans and AI agents can reason about it easily.

## What's Included

**Products & catalog** — Variants with per-variant pricing and stock, faceted attributes, multi-language translations, smart collections with rule-based filtering, and hierarchical categories.

**Orders & checkout** — State-machine order lifecycle, guest checkout with cookie-based cart tokens, stock reservations that prevent overselling, and a promotions engine with percentage/fixed discounts, usage limits, and customer group targeting.

**Payments & shipping** — Provider pattern that lets you swap implementations. Ships with Stripe for payments and Posti/Matkahuolto for shipping.

**Integrations** — PostgreSQL-backed job queue with retry and backoff, transactional events, sync runner for external systems, and webhook handlers — all without Redis or external dependencies.

**Admin & content** — Full dashboard for managing products, orders, customers, collections, promotions, content pages and reviews.
