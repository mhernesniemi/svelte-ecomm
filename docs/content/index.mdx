# Introduction

**Hoikka** is an opinionated, full-stack e-commerce platform built with SvelteKit.

It includes the storefront, admin panel, API, and business logic in a single lightweight codebase and is ready to deploy serverless.

## Philosophy: Code Over Configuration

Hoikka follows the principles of the [Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine), favoring clarity, strong defaults, and real application code over abstraction layers.

There are no plugin systems, configuration DSLs, or hidden admin logic. Everything is plain TypeScript that you can read, change, and extend directly.

This also makes Hoikka well-suited for AI-assisted development - the codebase is structured so that both humans and AI agents can reason about it easily.
